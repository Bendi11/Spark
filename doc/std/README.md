# Standard Library Specification
The following docs are the specification of the standard library, to ensure that exactly the same API is used
no matter the platform that the standard library is built for. It specifies function names and signatures, plus type names and purposes for them.
Function bodies and type bodies are (obviously) allowed to differ per-platform.
